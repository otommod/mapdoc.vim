# mapdoc

There have been plugins in the past to *attach* documentation to your mappings.
Some that I know of are:

    * [vim-follow-my-lead](https://github.com/ktonga/vim-follow-my-lead)
    * [ctrlp-leader-guide](https://github.com/tracyone/ctrlp-leader-guide)
    * [vim-leader-guide](https://github.com/hecal3/vim-leader-guide)
    * [vim-showmap](https://github.com/fcpg/vim-showmap)

This plugin is mostly an amalgamation of all of them.  However, the main
inspiration has been [vim-leader-guide].

There's not much that I can say.  I wrote this mostly for myself.  Still, if
you use this and find some bug, or want some feature open an Issue.  I'll
probably fix/implement it.

# TODO

    * Add docs
